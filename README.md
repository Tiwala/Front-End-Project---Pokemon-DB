* Welcome to Gerard's 1st-Generation Pokedex! Once you open this project, it immediately returns a list of the original 151 Pokemon from the 1st Generation!

* The information on each Pokemon includes the following:
    - Image
    - Name, and National Pokedex #
    - Height
    - Weight
    - Default ability
    - Typing
    - Pokedex description
    - Cry button
        - On click, returns the Pokemon's original cry from the first generation of Pokemon games from the Game Boy Color!

* Additional features include a search bar, where you type a Pokemon's exact name in lowercase, and returns its Pokedex entry

* Clicking the logo reloads the page and brings you back to the top!

* Lessons learned:
    - An firm understanding of the fundamentals of CSS and HTML go a long way and make a large difference; this made life a lot easier for me compared to previous projects
    - It isn't feasible to completely remember all operators and methods we use; we just have to know they exist and understand how they work, and things will be fine
    - Outlining my work early on makes creating it a lot smoother
    - Time flies quickly while coding and it's important to keep track of time
